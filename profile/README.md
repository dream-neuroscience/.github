# Action control in the dream state
Towards a synergy between lucid dream and action control research

## Bullet Points
-	Recognition of offline generation in the sleep state allows targeted action control in a context of an unconstrained environmental model
-	Action control in dream state largely unexplored by basic science, but of potentially great clinical, social, individual, and existential relevance 
-	Disentangling the concepts of sleep, dream and lucid dream through a simplified framework of integrative theories (Free Energy, Local Sleep)
-	New approaches to inducing LD derived from  
    1. simplified framework --> **conceptual improvements**;  
    2. literature synthesis, why previous induction approaches did not work --> **methodological improvements**

## Three-Step Plan
