# Action control in the dream state
Towards a synergy between lucid dream and action control research

## Bullet Points
-	Recognition of offline generation in the sleep state allows targeted action control in a context of an unconstrained environmental model
-	Action control in dream state largely unexplored by basic science, but of potentially great clinical, social, individual, and existential relevance 
-	Disentangling the concepts of sleep, dream and lucid dream through a simplified framework of integrative theories (Free Energy, Local Sleep)
-	New approaches to inducing LD derived from  
    1. simplified framework  
--> **conceptual improvements**;  
    2. literature synthesis, why previous induction approaches did not work  
--> **methodological improvements**

## Three-Step Plan

## Relevance
-	Establishment of a "new" field of research, opens up systematic investigations of the psychology of the second main behavioural state besides the waking state --> basic research
o	also to debunk charlatan science - robust results
-	Utilization of lost life time as new experience time --> existential, psychological well-being and social relevance
-	possible dream world feedback as diagnostics and trial/error feedback to adjust the world model --> clinical research
o	BUT: couldn't this be easily and better adapted in waking? better stimulus control and better observable behavioral output
	--> TODO better outline advantage of world simulation 
•	little interference from adaptations with fine physical information
o	--> research question: how "free" is simulation in dream? also only completely dependent on noise? --> then difficult; neuroscientific Literature, look for evidence)
o	TODO suggestions for dream recording
	consult Windt (2015) again
	definitely pursue Kamitani research: https://github.com/KamitaniLab/DeepImageReconstruction 
	View: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVj3sU37gdI 
	maybe test overlapping AI-visual-mental-reader (theoretically and ask Amirali)
o	TODO Figure what is independent variable and what is dependent variable is compared with classical psychology
-	better use of out-of-the-box thinking/knowledge (see video Moran Cerf: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8omtehc9uEI ) without forgetting it beforehand --> productivity, possibly work/organizational psychological value
