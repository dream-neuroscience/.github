# Action control in the dream state
Towards a synergy between lucid dream and action control research

## Bullet Points
-	Recognition of offline generation in the sleep state allows targeted action control in a context of an unconstrained environmental model
-	Action control in dream state largely unexplored by basic science, but of potentially great clinical, social, individual, and existential relevance 
-	Disentangling the concepts of sleep, dream and lucid dream through a simplified framework of integrative theories (Free Energy, Local Sleep)
-	New approaches to inducing LD derived from  
    1. simplified framework  
--> **conceptual improvements**;  
    2. literature synthesis, why previous induction approaches did not work  
--> **methodological improvements**

## Simplified Framework
- dreams correspond to epiphenomenal offline world model
- "lucid" dreaming: dissociative state: awareness of situatedness in veridical environment despite non-veridical perceptual world model
- "local sleep" explains both lucid dreams and sleep per se
    - lucid dreaming is rare local dissociation
    - global sleep emerges normally from local interactions (most parsimonious explanation of sleep!)
- cognition of offline generation allows specific action control in a context of an environmental model that is not constrained (by embedding environment)

## Three-Step Plan

## Relevance
-	**basic research**:
    - Establishment of a "new" field of research, opens up systematic investigations of the psychology of the second main behavioural state besides the waking state
    - also to debunk charlatan science - robust results
-	**existential, psychological well-being and social relevance**: 
    - Utilization of lost life time as new experience time
- **clinical research**:
    - possible dream world feedback as diagnostics and trial/error feedback to adjust the world model
- **productivity, possibly work/organizational psychological value**:
    - better use of out-of-the-box thinking/knowledge without forgetting it upon waking up
